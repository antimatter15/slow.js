This is some serious syntactic magic.

This is all automatic, no need to learn anything new. No new syntax, no new operators, functions or such.

Everything sort of just works, or at least, I want to draw you into this project by making it sound as if it was some magical box where parentheses and curly brackets go in and out comes ponies on butterflies that flutter across the clear azure sky. In reality it's not that magical unicorn dust I'm trying to convince you that it is.

This project is somewhat similar to the js deferred, async.js, coffescript defer, and the other ones. However, there are a few differences.
